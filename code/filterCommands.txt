Example: src.ip==192.168.202.102 || dest.port==4578

Filter commands usage:

* Applying filters on CIDS GUI is similar as in Wireshark. You filter by
  columns, so the name of each column's filter are the following:

  COLUMN                  FILTER NAME
  Source IP               src.ip
  Source Port             src.port
  Destination IP          dest.ip
  Destination Port        dest.port
  Classification          clf
  Message                 msg
  Cluster Number          cluster

* After the filter name, you have to choose a comparative operator. The
  only 2 comparative operators currently supported are equal and not equal:
  
  NAME        SYMBOL
  Equal       ==
  Not Equal   !=

* Immediately after the comparative operator you must type the value you
  are searching for.

* You can apply multiple filters at once by using The logical Operators
  AND and OR as shown below :

  NAME        SYMBOL
  AND         &&
  OR          &&

* Examples. Note that you can't have spaces between the filter name,
  comparative operator, and value. 
  
  cluster==4
  src.ip==192.168.202.102 && dest.port==4877
  dest.port!=80 || clf==Web
  msg==Attack && cluster!=0
