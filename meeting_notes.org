* Meeting Notes
** 16 September 2020
- GUI Demonstration and Feedback:

  - The GUI for our Prototype is demonstrating layout;
    specifically, that our *basic* model will look similar to a *SIEMS*
    tool discussed in the previous meeting. Our scratch-up is below:

  #+CAPTION: Concept
  [[./imgs/concept.png]]

  - Our initial "prototye" is shown below. The prototype is meant to
    demonstrate three user areas:

    1. Action panel (north). This is where the user selects actions to
       execute.
    2. Filter panel (bottom left). This is where the user will select
       filters, clusters, etc to display on the right hand side.
    3. Packet panel (bottom right). This is where the data packets
       will be displayed. This is not currently broken into fields,
       but will be.

  - More specifically, the prototype aims to complete the functional
    requirements and acceptance testing shown in the table below.

  - The current milestone requires customer feedback on the milestone:
    #+BEGIN_QUOTE
    "Customer feedback: Customer Involvement Alert => Prior to
    delivering this milestone, demo your operational Prototype and acceptance
    test case for your Customer. Present the feedback from your Customer
    regarding this demo to include whether your Customer agrees that you
    have demonstrated completion of the applicable acceptance test cases and
    any changes they want made."
    #+END_QUOTE

  - Instructor feedback:
    - Separate clusters by color in the data panel
    - Data should be able to come from multiple sources
    - Be able to connect to other users. TCP/IP
    - One user should be able to initiate collaboration

*** Other discussion
- Differential privacy review
  - Achieved via addition of random noise
  - Benefit -- provably secure

- The rest of the discussion was on clustering and on the differential privacy.
  The discussion was included in the following link: https://docs.google.com/document/d/19XImfqUX-phXZn_5oWGkPs97NRoG7dks_SjsjLCiTSo/edit

** 09 September 2020

- Improve implementation on categorical attributes (this is the
  bottleneck in latest implementation)

- Combine differential privacy with secure sharing to achieve better
  efficiency (differential privacy is more efficient but less accurate
  due to noise added)

  - [[file:research/differential_privacy_tutorial.pdf][Differential Privacy Tutorial]]

- Privacy preserving solutions to other collaborative IDS tasks, e.g.,
  rule-based, sequence-based. Currently we only do clustering of
  similar alerts but users can use more complex rule/sequential
  patterns. E.g., to identify a compromised machine used to launch
  attacks. (so there will be two alerts, first showing attack on the
  machine, second showing attack launched by that machine).

- Implement a GUI that allow users to detect IDS collaboratively and
  visualize results. It may look similar to SIEM tools. The following
  link give you some idea common SIEM tools
  [[https://www.dnsstuff.com/free-siem-tools][SIEM Tools (free)]]

- Functional Requirements, in short:

  - Improve implementation
  - Implement differential privacy

    - Combine with secret sharing

  - Pattern based to determine attacks

    - Rule based

  - Snort alerts

    - Different data sets
    - Security data set repository

  - GUI

    - Take the low level alerts as input
    - Take the sensors and file as input
    - Tasks and result of tasks
    - Display super alerts
    - Same interfaces for everyone

      - Communicating with peers
